# Project from one of the university courses

This repository contains a course exercise focusing on data structures and algorithms. The project involved creating a weighted graph from towns and roads, enabling the implementation various graph algorithms.

## Project Description

The project implements several graph traversal and searching algorithms, including depth-first search, breadth-first search, Kruskal's algorithm, and A* algorithm.
